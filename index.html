            <p>Jim Corbett National Park can be befittingly called the paradise of Tigers in India.
                Area of the Jim Corbett Park is 520.82 sq km (1318 sq km Corbett National Park including
                Sonanadi Wildlife Sanctuary).
                The park is named after the legendary tiger hunter turned naturalist Jim Corbett (British
                hunter-1875-1955).
                During its inception, the name of the park was Hailey National Park,
                which was rechristened afterward in the honor of the great conservationist and naturalist Jim Corbett,
                who hunted down tigers that had turned man-eaters in Kumaon, Uttarakhand, between 1907 to 1939.</p>

            <p>The project tiger was launched in 1973.
                The basic intention of Project Tiger is to maintain the ecological balance of nature and
                conserve extant ecosystems. The project seeks to establish a natural link between the wildlife & flora
                of
                national parks and sanctuaries and the humans living on their peripheries. It also seeks to create
                awareness
                about harm to environment and preservation efforts.</p>
